Hey ðŸŒ±

   

Welcome to my garden of data trees. With a background in [[Index/Computational Neuroscience\|Computational Neuroscience]], I become a [data enthusiast](https://yannansoda.github.io/) taking care of my trees of [[Index/Math\|Math]], [[Index/Statistics\|Statistics]], [[Index/Data Science\|Data Science]], [[Index/Machine Learning\|Machine Learning]], AI, [[Index/Cloud Computing\|Cloud Computing]], etc.

I am also a gardener in [Words in World](https://words-in-world.vercel.app), another green place where my thoughts about books and photography grow. 

*This garden is built with theÂ [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) and Netlify. I recommend to zoom out to 80% for better visualization.*
