Hey ðŸŒ±

I am not a fan of soda, but I adore bubbles - the metaphors of ideas in my watery noisy brain.   

Most of my bubbles are about [Computational Neuroscience](Index/Computational%20Neuroscience%20Index.md), [Statistics](Index/Statistics%20Index.md), and [[Notes/Machine Learning\|Machine Learning]], plus random thoughts on [[Books\|Books]] and photography. 

This garden is still under construction. 
It was built with theÂ [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) and Netlify.
