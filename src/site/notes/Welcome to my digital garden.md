Hey ðŸŒ±

I am not a fan of soda, but I adore bubbles - the metaphors of ideas in my watery noisy brain.   

Most of my bubbles are about [[CompNeuro/Computational Neuroscience\|Computational Neuroscience]], [[StatsCards/Statistics\|Statistics]], and [[ML/Machine Learning\|Machine learning]], plus random thoughts on [[Books\|Books]] and photography. 

This garden is still under construction. 
It was built with theÂ [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) and Netlify.
