Hey ðŸŒ±

_**I am not a fan of soda, but I adore bubbles - the metaphors of ideas in my watery noisy brain.**_

Welcome to my garden.

Here are many data trees. With a back
ground in [[Index/Computational Neuroscience\|Computational Neuroscience]] and a career in [[Index/AIxHealth\|AIxHealth]], I become a [data enthusiast](https://yannansoda.github.io/) taking care of my trees of [[Index/Math\|Math]], [[Index/Statistics\|Statistics]], [[Index/Data Science\|Data Science]], [[Index/Machine Learning\|Machine Learning]], [[Index/Deep Learning\|Deep Learning]], [[Index/Large Language Model & AI Engineering\|Large Language Model & AI Engineering]], [[Index/Cloud Computing\|Cloud Computing]], etc.

Green also grows from the words in [[Index/Some Books I Have Read\|Some Books I Have Read]] and in my head - random [[Index/Flash Thoughts\|Flash Thoughts]] about everything.
