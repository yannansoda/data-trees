# Data Science Tools
- Apache Hadoop
	- Hadoop is an open-source framework that is used for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. It consists of two main components: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storing data and MapReduce for processing data.
- Apache Spark
	- Spark ([[StudyNotes/Big Data#Spark\|Big Data#Spark]]) is another open-source framework that is used for distributed processing of large datasets, aka. It provides a unified analytics engine for batch processing, real-time processing, machine learning, and graph processing.
- [[StudyNotes/SQL\|SQL]] and NoSQL [[StudyNotes/Database\|Database]]s
	- SQL databases: such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle, are used for structured data storage and querying 
	- NoSQL databases: such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis, are used for unstructured and semi-structured data storage and querying.
- [[StudyNotes/ETL\|ETL]] tools
	- build data pipelines and automate data integration, cleansing, and transformation.
	- Apache NiFi, Talend, Informatica
- Data warehouse tools  ([[StudyNotes/Data Warehouse & Data Lake#What is Data Warehouse\|Data Warehouse & Data Lake#What is Data Warehouse]])
	- store and manage large datasets for business intelligence and analytics
	- Amazon Redshift ([[StudyNotes/AWS Storage & Databases#Amazon Redshift\|AWS Storage & Databases#Amazon Redshift]]), Google BigQuery, Snowflake
- Data integration tools
	- ingest and integrate data from various sources into data pipelines
	- such as Apache Kafka, Apache Flume, and AWS Glue
- Data visualization and reporting tools
	- create interactive dashboards and reports to communicate insights and trends from data.
	- Tableau, Power BI, and Looker
- Cloud platforms
	- provide infrastructure, tools, and services for deploying, managing, and scaling data engineering solutions in the cloud.
	- AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure
