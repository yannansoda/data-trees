## Gradient descent

## Optimization challenges
### Common challenges
- local minima
- saddle points
	- any location where all gradients of a function vanish but which is neither a global nor a local minimum

### Challenges in DL
- Almost all optimization problems arising in deep learning are *nonconvex*
