Transfer learning is the reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem. 
> consider somebody else's model trained on a lot more data. They have convolutional layers and they're here intact with features that have already been learned. So you can lock them instead of retraining them on your data, and have those just extract the features from your data using the convolutions that they've already learned.
