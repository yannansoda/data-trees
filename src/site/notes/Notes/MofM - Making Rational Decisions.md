>This chapter **Cracking the Neural Code** is about the Bayes' rule and the Bayesian brain.

**Hermann von Helmholtz**
- how humans perceive, decide and act: "unconscious inference"

**Girolamo Cardano**
- probability of gambling

**Pierre-Simon Laplace**
- the equation for inverse probability

**Thomas Bayes**
- the Bayes' rule - based on the problem for inverse probability

**early work on Bayesian principles in the brain**
- Renwick Curry: motion perception (of astronauts)
- William Viscusi: economical decision-making

**1987, John Anderson**
- rational analysis: humans should have evolved to behave as rationally as possible
- e.g. memory recall should be rational (and can be not perfect)

**1996, David Knill & Whitman Richards**
- book _Perception as Bayesian Inference_

**Example researches**
- motion perception
- the switching of ambiguous illusions like the Necker Cube
- confidence
- Dora Angelaki: visual-vestibular 

**The prior is constant?**
- Pascal Mamassian: human assumes light comes from above and slightly to the left
	- 1970 :raised chicken showed an inherited prior preferring that light comes from above
	- 2010 James Stone: a partially innate prior may be fine-tuned by experience
	- 2004 : the prior belief about the source of the light can be changed by training

**Neural signatures of the Bayesian brain**
- 2011, Brian Fischer et al: neural representations of priors in owl's brain
