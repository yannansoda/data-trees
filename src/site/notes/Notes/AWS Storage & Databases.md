>**Object storage vs. Block storage**

### Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) 
Because an instance store provides only **temporary** block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance, we need storage services that can **persist data after EC2 termination**.
- block-level storage for EC2 instances that persists data even after termination
- need to define configuration
- need to take incremental backups using Amazon EBS snapshots 
	- incremental = only the data that have changed since the most recent snapshot is backed up ![Pasted image 20230629110728.png|400](/img/user/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020230629110728.png)
### Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- object-level storage that stores data as objects in buckets
- data can be accessed with an object key along with the bucket name
- unlimited storage space, with the maximum file size for an object as 5 TB
- web enabled
- perfect foundation for Data Lake ([[Notes/Data Warehouse & Data Lake\|Data Warehouse & Data Lake]])
- can choose from a range of storage classes:
