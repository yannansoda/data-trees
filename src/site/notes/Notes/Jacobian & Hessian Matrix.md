### Jacobian matrix  
- represents the rate of change of a vector-valued function with respect to its input variables
- contains the partial derivatives of each component of y with respect to each component of x
- provides information about the local linear transformations at a given point.
### The Hessian matrix
- is derived from the Jacobian matrix
- characterizes the second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function 
- is used in optimization to analyze the curvature of the function's graph
