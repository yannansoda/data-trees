- a statistical method used to explore the underlying structure of a set of variables
- it aims to finding latent variables
- based on the _common factor model_: there a certain number of factors in a data set, and that each of the measured variables captures a part of one or more of those factors.

>[!Factor analysis vs. PCA]
> - In PCA ([[Notes/Dimensionality Reduction#PCA vs. LDA\|Dimensionality Reduction#PCA vs. LDA]]): only one fixed outcome that orders the components from the highest explanatory value to the lowest explanatory value
> - Factor Analysis: more flexible for interpretation
