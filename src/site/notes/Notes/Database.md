Database often refers to relational database.

# Relational database
 = A relational model organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. 
 - Rows are also called records or tuples. Columns are also called attributes. 
 - Generally, each table/relation represents one "entity type" (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as "Lee" or "chair") and the columns representing values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).
 

# Relational database management system (RDBMS)
 It is a set of software tools that controls the data such as access, organization, and storage. 
 It is often equipped with [[Notes/SQL\|SQL]].
