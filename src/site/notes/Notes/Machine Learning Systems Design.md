# MLOps
### What is MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)
- Ops in MLOps comes from DevOps, short for Developments and Operations. 
- To operationalize something means to bring it into production, which includes deploying, monitoring, and maintaining it. 
- MLOps is a set of tools and best practices for bringing ML into production.
### Requirements for ML Systems
- **Reliability**
- **Scalability**
	- resource scaling
	- artifact management
- **Maintainability**
- **Adaptability **
	- data distribution shifts
- **Continual Learning**: [[Notes/ML System Monitoring and Continual learning#Continual Learning\|ML System Monitoring and Continual learning#Continual Learning]]

# Iterative Process of Developing an ML system
## 1. Project scoping
## 2. Data engineering
### Data pipeline in MLOps
#### Major types of data problems
- unstructured vs. structured
	- unstructured: humans can label data; data augmentation is feasible
	- structured: hard to obtain more data
- small vs. big data
	- small data: clean and consistent labels are critical
	- big data: data process are important
#### Data pipeline at difference phases
- POC (proof-of-concept)
	- goal is to decide if the application is workable and worth deploying
	- focus on getting the prototype to work
	- acceptable if data pre-processing is manual - but take extensive notes/comments
- production phase
	- after project utility is established, use more sophisticated tools to make sure the data pipeline is replicable  
#### Best practice
- to keep track of:
	- data provenance: where data comes from
	- data lineage: sequence of steps applied to data
- use meta-data
## 3. ML model development
### Coping with ML training challenges
#### Checkpointing
- check points include
	- model architecture
	- model weights
	- training configurations
	- optimizer
- take two things into consideration: frequency and number of checkpoints
#### Distributed training strategies 
-> scale challenges: increased training data volume or increased model size and complexity
- Distributed training = split training load across multiple compute nodes or clusters (CPU/GPU)
- there are two strategies
	- data parallelism: training data split up + model replicated on all notes
	- model parallelism: training data replicated + model split up on all nodes
	- which to choose: ![Pasted image 20231004115356.png|400](/img/user/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020231004115356.png)

### Best practice: Sanity-check test
- try to overfit a small training dataset before training on a large one

# Infrastructure and Tooling for MLOps
### Infrastructure

### Storage & Compute
- storage layer: where data is collected and stored
	- hard drive disk (HDD), solid state disk (SSD)
	- [[Notes/AWS Storage & Databases#Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)\|AWS Storage & Databases#Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)]], Snowflake
- compute layer: all the compute resources a company has access to and the mechanism to determine how these resources can be used
	- CPU, GPU
	- [[Notes/Amazon EC2\|Amazon EC2]], GCP
### Development Environment
- IDE (Integrated development environment)
	- cloud IDE: AWS Cloud9, Amaon SageMaker Studio
- versioning
- CI/CD
### Resource Management
- Cron, Schedulers, Orchestrators
	- cron: it run a script at a predetermined time and tell you whether the job succeeds or fails
	- scheduler & orchestrator
		- scheduler: cron programs deciding when 
		- orchestrator: cron programs concerning where to get resources. e.g. Kubernetes
		- scheduler and orchestrator can be used interchangeably 
- Data science workflow management ![Pasted image 20230719161709.png|400](/img/user/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020230719161709.png)
### Pipeline Orchestration
orchestration allows managing end to end traceability of pipeline using automation to capture specific inputs, outputs, and artifacts of a given task. 
- **Model lineage**
	- for each version of a trained model, versions of
		- data used
		- code/hyperparamters used
		- algorithm/framework
		- training docker image
		- packages/libraries 
- **Model registry**
{ #8e6855}

	- centrally manage model metadata and model artifacts
	- track which models are deployed across environments
- **Artifact tracking**
	- artifact = the output of a step or task can be consumed by the next step in a pipeline or deployed directly for consumption
