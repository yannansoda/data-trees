### What is conjugate prior
In Bayesian statistics, if the posterior $p(\theta | y)$ and the prior $p(\theta)$ follow a same type of distribution (e.g. both follow the normal distribution), we will say this prior is conjugate for the likelihood $p(y|\theta)$.
>[!Note]
 You can always say that **a  prior is a conjugate for a likelihood; but a posterior never has conjugates.**

### Why need conjugate prior
If the prior is conjugate for the likelihood, we can compute the posterior in closed form.
