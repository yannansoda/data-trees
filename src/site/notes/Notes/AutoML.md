AutoML = Automated Machine Learning
### Benefits
- reduce time-to-market
- lower ML barrier to entry for non-data scientists
- iterate quickly using ML & automation
- save scarce resources for more challenging use cases
### AutoML workflow
- AutoML can automate this workflow: 
	- problem identification -> algorithm selection -> data preprocessing -> hyperparameter tuning
- considerations
	- transparency and control

### Automated model tuning
- popular algorithms
	- grid search
	- random search
	- Bayesian optimization
	- hyperband: based on bandit approach, which typically uses a combination of exploitation and exploration to find the best possible hyperparameters. 

### Tools
- Amazon SageMaker Autopilot: [[Notes/AWS for Data Science#^a5ba5d\|AWS for Data Science#^a5ba5d]]
