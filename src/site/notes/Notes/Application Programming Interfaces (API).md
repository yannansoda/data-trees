### API
 An API lets two pieces of software talk to each other using the client/server architectural style. It allows programmatically accessing some data or perform some action.
 
### REST API
REST = Representational State Transfer 
- two components: request and response
- They enable you to communicate using the internet, taking advantage of storage, greater data access, artificial intelligence algorithms, and many other resources.
- e.g. web service inputs into client via API; API outputs data into client
- Common API endpoints
	- GET: retrieves some data
	- POST: sends some data to create something and receive a response
	- PUT: sends data to update something that already exists
	- DELETE
### API frameworks
