## Procedural Programming
A programming paradigm that organizes code into procedures or functions, focusing on a step-by-step sequence of instructions to perform tasks

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
### Definition
- OOP is concerned with objects, which are custom data structures.
- In OOP, a class defines new objects, which can have attributes and methods.
### Principles
- **encapsulation** = your class hides its details from the outside
- **abstraction** = you should deal with a class at the appropriate level of detail
- **inheritance** = you can extend a class by creating another class that builds on it
- **polymorphism** = you can have the same interface for different classes, which simplifies your code and reduces repetition
## Functional Programming (FP)
### Definition
- FP is concerned with functions that donâ€™t change the underlying data
- In FP, ideally everything is within the function
### Examples
- lambda functions and map()
### OOP vs. FP
- OOP for things that need something done to them
- FP for things that should remain fixed or operations can be parallelized with a large amount of data
## Dynamic Programming (DP)
An optimization technique for solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.
