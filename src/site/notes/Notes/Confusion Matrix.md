# Performance measures
## Accuracy 
= the fraction of the total samples that were correctly classified by the classifier

$$(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)$$
## Misclassification Rate/Classification Error
= the fraction of predictions were incorrect

$$(FP+FN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)$$ or $$(1-Accuracy)$$
## Precision
= the fraction of predictions as a positive class were actually positive
$$TP/(TP+FP)$$
## Sensitivity / True Positive Rate (TPR) / Probability of Detection / Recall
= the fraction of all positive samples were correctly predicted as positive by the classifier
$$TP/(TP+FN)$$
## Specificity / True Negative Rate (TNR)
= the fraction of all negative samples are correctly predicted as negative by the classifier
$$TN/(TN+FP)$$
>[!Interesting]

>accuracy = sensitivity x prevalence + specificity x (1 - prevalence)

## F1-score: 
= It combines precision and recall into a single measure. Mathematically itâ€™s the harmonic mean of precision and recall (range in $[0, 1]$)
$$F1\ score = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Sensitivity}{Precision + Sensitivity}$$
>[!Quote] The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book
>**How to choose between precision and sensitivity**
>- by assigning a higher weighting to the examples of (the SVM algorithm accepts weightings of classes as input)
>- by tuning hyperparameters to maximize precision or recall on the validation set
>- by varying the decision threshold for algorithms that return probabilities of classes; for instance, if we use logistic regression or decision tree, to increase precison

# Cumulative Accuracy Profile (CAP)
*resource*: https://waleblaq.medium.com/the-cap-curves-the-cumulative-accuracy-profile-58a141e01fae
 - CAP is used to visualize the discriminative power of a model. 
 - The CAP of a model represents the cumulative number of positive outcomes along the y-axis versus the corresponding cumulative number of a classifying parameter along the x-axis.
 ## CAP Analysis
We can analyze the cap curve in 2 ways.
 ### Way 1: ratio of the areas under the good model to the area under the ideal curve

 ### Way 2:

# Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) & AUC
## ROC
- ROC != CAP
- ROC plots the true-positive rate ([[Notes/Confusion Matrix#Sensitivity / True Positive Rate (TPR) / Probability of Detection / Recall\|Confusion Matrix#Sensitivity / True Positive Rate (TPR) / Probability of Detection / Recall]]) against the false-positive rate, where false-positive rate is the proportion of negative examples predicted incorrectly:$$FP/(FP+TN)$$

## (ROC) AUC 

ROC AUC = ROC Area Under the Curve
- ranging from 0 to 1
- 0.5 for random classifier

### Tests for comparing AUC

- **Delong's test**
	-  to compare two AUCs derived from the same dataset for a binary classification
	- nonparametric approach: it uses a rank-based method to compute variances and covariances of AUC estimates
	- The test statistic ($z$) is given by:

$$
z = \frac{\text{AUC}_1 - \text{AUC}_2}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(\text{AUC}_1) + \text{Var}(\text{AUC}_2) - 2 \cdot \text{Cov}(\text{AUC}_1, \text{AUC}_2)}}
$$
