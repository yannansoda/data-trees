- _MCMC_Â is essentially [[Notes/Monte Carlo Method\|Monte Carlo Method]] integration using [[Notes/Markov Chain\|Markov Chain]]
- The key of MCMC is that we want to make the distribution approximate to a stationary distribution.
>[!Stationary distribution]
>Assume a probability distribution $\Phi (t)$ at each status $X_t$. When the $\Phi(t)$ is same for every status and remains constant as $\Phi(k)$, we call $\{\Phi (k)\}$ is the stationary distribution of $\{X_t\}$.
