- The likelihood ratio test (LRT) is a statistical test of the goodness-of-fit between two models. 
- A relatively more complex model is compared to a simpler model to see if it fits a particular dataset significantly better. If so, the additional parameters of the more complex model are often used in subsequent analyses. 
- The LRT is only valid if used to compare ==hierarchically nested models==. That is, the more complex model must differ from the simple model only by the addition of one or more parameters. 
- Adding additional parameters will always result in a higher likelihood score. However, there comes a point when adding additional parameters is no longer justified in terms of significant improvement in fit of a model to a particular dataset. The LRT provides one objective criterion for selecting among possible models.
