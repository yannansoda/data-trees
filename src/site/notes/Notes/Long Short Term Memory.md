### What is LSTM
- It is a type of [[Notes/Recurrent Neural Networks\|Recurrent Neural Networks]] architecture
- It is designed to address the vanishing/exploding gradient problem (see [[Notes/Optimization Algorithms#^4a1546\|Optimization Algorithms#^4a1546]]) in traditional RNNs, allowing it to effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.


### Long vs Short
- why "long": It is a unique structure with memory cells that can store and access information over long periods
- long-term memories = cell states: no weights, thus to avoid vanishing/exploding gradients
- short-term memories = hidden states: with weights, just as vanilla RNNs

#### three key components
- input gates
	- activation function is tanh (-1 to 1)
	- even though this part determines how we should update the long-term memory....
- forget gates 
	 - activation function is sigmoid (0 to 1)
	 - decides what percentage of the long-term memory is remembered
- output gates
