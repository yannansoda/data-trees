# What is a transformer
A transformer is a deep learning model architecture that is primarily used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as language translation, question-answering, and sentiment analysis. 
- key innovation: self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different times during processing.
