When the hidden variables of a [[Notes/Markov chain\|Markov chain]] are continuous and probability distributions are Gaussians, then the model is usually called a Kalman model. 
- When these models are used to make estimates about a given point of time, given only the past, they are generally called “filters” (Kalman filter)
- when they make estimates given both past and future, they are called “smoothers.”
