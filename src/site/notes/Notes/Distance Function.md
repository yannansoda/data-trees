### Euclidian distance

### Cosine similarity
= a measure of similarity of the directions of two vectors. 
$$
s(x_i, x_k) := cos(\angle(x_i, x_k)) 
$$
- If the angle between two vectors is 
	- 0 -> two vectors point to the same direction
	- 1 -> two vectors are orthogonal
	- -1 -> two vectors pointing in opposite directions

### Other functions
- Chebychev distance
- Mahalanobis distance
- Hamming distance
