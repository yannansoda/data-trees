# The problem of veracity
- Data changes over time. As it is transferred from one process to another, and through one system and another, there are opportunities for the integrity of the data to be negatively impacted.
- The veracity of the data is tested in data sharing.

# Data integrity 
Data veracity is contingent on the integrity of the data.
- Data integrity = the maintenance and assurance of the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle.
- Referential integrity
	- the process of ensuring that the constraints of table relationships are enforced
- Domain integrity
	- the process of ensuring that the data being entered into a field matches the data type defined for that field
- Entity integrity
	- the process of ensuring that the values stored within a field match the constraints defined for that field
