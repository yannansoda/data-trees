# AWS service for messaging, serverless computing, and containers
## Messaging and queuing
Applications are made of multiple components.
- For example, there are **monolithic applications** = an application with **tightly coupled components**. If one component fails, other components fail.
- To help maintain application availability when a single component fails, we can design our application through a **microservices approach** 
	- In a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled. 
	- Two services facilitate application integration
		- **Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)**: a publish/subscribe service (subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions, etc.)
		- **Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)**: a message queuing service
## Containerized applications
can be achieved by
- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)**: support Docker
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)**: support Kubernetes
## Serverless computing 
- your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers
- the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically
- can be achieved by 
	- **ASW Lambda** ![Pasted image 20230624120815.png|400](/img/user/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020230624120815.png)
{ #08bc66}

	- **AWS Fargate**: run your containers on top of a serverless compute platform


# Ways to interact with AWS services
- AWS Management Console
	- a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services
- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
	- automate actions for AWS services and applications through scripts
- Software development kits (SDKs)
	- make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform. 
- AWS Management Tools
	- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
		- you provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:
			- Adjust capacity
			- Load balancing
			- Automatic scaling
{ #c7080d}

			- Application health monitoring
	- AWS CloudFormation
		- treat your infrastructure as code: you can build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources.
		- It determines the right operations to perform when managing your stack and rolls back changes automatically if it detects errors.
	- AWS Outposts
		- Extend AWS infrastructure and services to your on-premises data center.
