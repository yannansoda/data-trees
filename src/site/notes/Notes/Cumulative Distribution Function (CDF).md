# Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

For a random variable X, there is a cumulative distribution function for X:

$$P(X \le x) = F(x) (- \infty < x < \infty)$$

This function has 2 features:

-   F(x) is monotonous and not decreasing:

$$F(x_1) \leq F(x_2) \ $$ 
for
$$ x_1 \leq x_2$$

-   when x → + $\infty$, F(x) → 1; when x → - $\infty$, F(x) → 0

CDF is defined for both [[Notes/Random variables & Probability distributions#Discrete variables\|Random variables & Probability distributions#Discrete variables]] and [[Notes/Random variables & Probability distributions#Continuous variables\|Random variables & Probability distributions#Continuous variables]].
