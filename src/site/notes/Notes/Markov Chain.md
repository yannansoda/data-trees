- Markov property: conditioned on the present state of the world, the past is independent from the future.

- Models of the Markov property that estimate 
	- discrete hidden variables:  [[Hidden Markov Models\|Hidden Markov Models]] (HMM)
	- continuous hidden variables (with Gaussian probability): [[Notes/Kalman model\|Kalman model]]
