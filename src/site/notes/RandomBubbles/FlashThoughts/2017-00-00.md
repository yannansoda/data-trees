#quote **Rick N Morty S3E3**: Because the thing about repairing, maintaining and cleaning is, it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people... Well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.
